## 🎮 Game Implementation Example

Adding a new game to PlayGrid is straightforward. Here's how the Coup game is implemented:

**Backend Game Logic**:
```typescript
export class CoupGame implements IGame {
    gameId = "coup";
    
    initGame(roomId: string, players: Player[]): CoupGameState {
        return {
            players: players.map(p => ({
                ...p,
                coins: 2,
                influence: this.dealInfluenceCards(2),
                isAlive: true
            })),
            currentTurnPlayerId: players[0].playerId,
            deck: this.createShuffledDeck(),
            gamePhase: "PLAYING"
        };
    }
    
    handleAction(roomId: string, action: GameAction, state: CoupGameState): CoupGameState {
        switch (action.type) {
            case "INCOME":
                return this.processIncomeAction(action, state);
            case "COUP":
                return this.processCoupAction(action, state);
            // ... other actions
        }
    }
}
```

**Frontend Game Component**:
```typescript
export default function CoupGame({ roomId }: { roomId: string }) {
    const [gameState, setGameState] = useState<CoupGameState | null>(null);
    
    const handlePlayerAction = (action: GameAction) => {
        socket?.emit('game:action', { roomId, gameId: 'coup', action });
    };
    
    return (
        <div className="coup-game">
            <GameBoard gameState={gameState} />
            <PlayerHand onAction={handlePlayerAction} />
            <ActionButtons gameState={gameState} onAction={handlePlayerAction} />
        </div>
    );
}
```
